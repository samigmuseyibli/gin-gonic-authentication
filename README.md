# Gin-gonic User Authentication Application
Clone the application to your `$GOPATH/src` and then run `dep ensure` and `go run main.go`
```
cd $GOPATH/src

go get github.com/samigmuseyibli/gin-gonic-authentication

cd github.com/samigmuseyibli/gin-gonic-authentication

go run main.go
```

Now try the endpoints using Postman or cURL with your session generated with the required `authType` from the login endpoint.
